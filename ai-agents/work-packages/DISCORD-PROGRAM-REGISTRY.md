# Discord moderation program registry

Owner authorization: on 2026-08-23 the owner authorized continued implementation of the Discord moderation platform and explicitly authorized a sequential worker system to carry the project forward. This registry activates `ES-D02` through `ES-D15` as the dedicated Discord-program lane. It does **not** authorize production deployment, production data access, LiteBans cutover, Discord production configuration changes, or issue #43 acceptance; those remain separately gated by repository policy.

The product authority is `docs/discord-moderation-platform.md`. The sequencing authority is this file plus the individual `ES-Dxx` package files. Live GitHub always overrides stale status text.

Dedicated Discord-program workers must reconcile the global `PACKAGE-REGISTRY.md` and all live PRs/branches for conflicts, but they select implementation work only from this lane. Unrelated `ES-Xxx`, `ES-Pxx`, website, competition, or other work never preempts a Discord-program worker unless it creates an actual path/schema/protocol collision that makes the selected Discord package unsafe.

## Active package

`ES-D03 — Authorization and cross-platform policy` is the selected actionable continuation on `package/es-d03-discord-authorization`, PR #149. Independent full-diff review found and repaired a fail-closed Developer/Minecraft authority gap at executable commit `6f0b3a8c264f8f7644a9bfafacb8b6cd29061950`; exact-head validation and final review are now required before completion.

## Latest completion

`ES-D02` remains the latest completed Discord package through PR #148. Its V19 persistence work remains unchanged by D03.

The earlier D03 candidate `ca66a97949cd8b9733c9039084d6230b2c63fd07` passed its recorded exact-head gates, but those results are historical only after the later executable repair. D03 is not complete until the repaired tree passes current exact-head acceptance, zero valid review findings remain, PR #149 merges normally, and post-merge containment/cleanup are verified.

`ES-D04` and `ES-D05` remain `PLANNED` while D03 is incomplete. If D03 reaches `COMPLETE`, both become dependency-complete and may be marked `READY`; this D03 worker must not start either package.

## Selection

Classify every incomplete `ES-Dxx` as `ACTIONABLE_CONTINUATION`, `PARKED_BLOCKED`, or `READY`. Select the highest-priority actionable continuation; otherwise select the lowest-priority dependency-complete ready package. Skip blocked packages. A live overlapping website/competition/other worker may make only the overlapping package temporarily `PARKED_BLOCKED`; it does not authorize conflicting edits and does not prevent another independent Discord package from being selected when dependencies permit.

Each worker completes exactly one package and stops only at `COMPLETE` or a genuine externally blocked terminal state after publishing durable state. The worker must not stop merely because it produced a plan, opened a draft PR, reached a first checkpoint, or is waiting on ordinary CI that it can inspect in the same session.
