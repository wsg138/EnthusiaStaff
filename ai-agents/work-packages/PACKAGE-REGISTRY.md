# Package registry

Last updated: 2026-08-10

Live GitHub overrides stale text. Detailed historical evidence remains in package files and canonical handoffs; this registry is the current routing authority.

## Rules

- Classify every incomplete package before selection and work exactly one package per worker.
- Existing `ACTIONABLE_CONTINUATION` work takes priority over newly `READY` work.
- Use normal merge commits only; never relabel missing, skipped, cancelled, superseded, wrong-revision, or failed validation as passing evidence.
- Do not weaken staging, provenance, migration, review, static-analysis, privacy, or production-authority boundaries.
- Issue #43 remains open/deferred and LiteBans remains authoritative until separately approved.

## Canonical current state

`ES-P01`, `ES-P02`, `ES-P03`, `ES-P04`, `ES-P05`, `ES-P07`, `ES-P09`, `ES-P10`, `ES-P11`, `ES-X05`, `ES-R01`, `ES-R02`, and `ES-V01` are `COMPLETE`.

`ES-P07 — Inventory and Ender editing runtime completion` completed on frozen implementation head `70b279998bbcc9a3ddd68b5f6e060d5a60662323`. PR #112 merged normally as `c96b0a2047e2e720bb4f18d32cf8c254d0302508`; the merge has pre-merge `main` `2d8fcf27b0bac980211149ae8f7f4e7798998ee5` and the frozen head as its two parents, is one commit ahead of the frozen head with zero file delta, and the implementation branch was automatically deleted after merge.

`ES-P06` remains `READY` at priority 60. ES-P07 completion makes `ES-P08` dependency-complete and therefore `READY` at priority 70. `ES-X01` remains `BLOCKED` / `PARKED_BLOCKED` because the supported RoseChat standalone repository, default branch, source, and AGENTS files required for integration remain unresolved. This ES-P07 worker does not activate another package.

## ES-P07 terminal record

- Original package start: `17fb50d02fdc35cffd1cbdc63e28f72cffd88315`.
- Final frozen implementation head: `70b279998bbcc9a3ddd68b5f6e060d5a60662323`.
- Hosted exact-head validation: Java 21 full build/tests with MariaDB/Testcontainers, runtime-JAR/provider-leak inspection, Wiki, aggregate JaCoCo, and Codacy upload all passed. Aggregate coverage was 47.14% lines, 38.24% branches, 49.80% instructions; validation artifact `9080140711`, digest `sha256:7c8a1df6bd5deaa2719febd588ab0c39925728291b475088f5e601e5b1e3624a`.
- Exact-head Codacy: zero static annotations; diff coverage 31.58%; coverage variation -0.04% against the -1.0% target.
- Review: CodeRabbit success and zero valid unresolved threads. A late request to place the final commit's own SHA inside files belonging to that commit was dispositioned as self-referential and invalid; PR metadata already held the literal frozen SHA, and the thread was resolved without changing the validated tree.
- Sentinel: exact artifact `9079917694`, digest `sha256:5e67feb5a4461cc468289a6ef063ad66b3b22c08f70dede750a32f501ab72132`; restart job 85 reached terminal `PAPER_RESTART_OK` with two clean readiness/start-stop cycles.
- Canonical Pi: fresh public run `31437103701` attempt 1 succeeded end-to-end and removed its transient public transfer. Correlated private run `31437719313` / job `93615505782` succeeded on trusted `Lincoln-PI-4` runner ID 2 with exact source/provenance verification, two Paper/storage-ready `SHADOW_MIGRATION` cycles, V1–V18 applied on the first cycle, schema v18 current/no-op on restart, clean shutdown/failure scans, and guarded post-test database cleanup. Sanitized evidence artifact `9082068813`, digest `sha256:db97da3300f462a091986dd8f752bd5e7fb374983bc6a2da8eaec94a96a28ea2`.
- Earlier final-head private attempts remain non-passing evidence: one failed before Paper on transient bridge HTTP 404; another correctly rejected a rerun-attempt manifest mismatch caused by reuse of the attempt-1 build artifact. Provenance was not weakened.
- PR #112 merged by normal merge commit `c96b0a2047e2e720bb4f18d32cf8c254d0302508`. Containment is exact: one merge commit ahead, zero behind, zero file differences. `package/es-p07-inventory-runtime` is deleted/404.
- V18 remains the immutable migration ceiling; ES-P07 added no migration. Issue #43 remains open/deferred; LiteBans remains authoritative. No production data, deployment, shadow window, cutover, punishment-authority change, source rewrite, or unrelated package work occurred.
- Canonical terminal handoff: `ai-agents/reports/package-handoffs/2026-08-10-es-p07-inventory-runtime-complete.md`.

## Next sequential action

This worker stops after terminal publication. A new worker must reconcile live GitHub before selecting work. If no `ACTIONABLE_CONTINUATION` appears, normal priority currently places `ES-P06` (60) before `ES-P08` (70). Do not treat this routing note as activation of either package.
