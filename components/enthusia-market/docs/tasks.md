## Sign item display names & truncation (REQ-299)

Reported: Netherite_Ingot (15 chars) doesn't show on sign. Custom anvil names lost.

- [ ] **TDD-299** — Sign renderer uses custom display name with truncation
  References: REQ-299
  Tag: TDD
  Description: Modify `ShopSignRenderer.lines()` to accept `displayName: Component?` — when non-null, use the custom display name with color preserved; otherwise fall back to `sellMaterialName`. Truncate plain text to 14 chars + "…" when longer, preserving the original Component's style. Update `SignPlaceListener` (pass `held.itemMeta?.displayName()`) and `CreateShopMenu.writeSignText()` (pass deserialized ItemStack's display name) to supply the custom name. Failing test first: custom name shown on sign line 1; long name truncated with "…" retaining color; no custom name falls back to Material.name.
  Evidence: `src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/application/ShopSignRenderer.kt`, `src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/infrastructure/listeners/SignPlaceListener.kt:130-200`, `src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/interaction/gui/CreateShopMenu.kt:248-264`, `src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/application/ItemStackSerializer.kt`, `net.kyori.adventure.text.Component`, `net.kyori.adventure.text.serializer.plain.PlainTextComponentSerializer`, `net.kyori.adventure.text.format.NamedTextColor`

  References: REQ-025
  Tag: TDD
  Description: Failing test: ContainerTradeService completes BUY on guild-owned shop → Vault withdraw from buyer, deposit to GuildVaultService (not player Vault). Player-owned shop still routes to player Vault. Confirm red. GuildVaultService is a provided interface via LumaGuildsHook.
  Evidence: `ContainerTradeService routes guild shop income to GuildProvider, 5 new tests`

  Evidence: `src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/interaction/gui/AuctionBrowserMenu.kt`, `src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/infrastructure/commands/AdminCommands.kt:auctionsBrowse`

## Phase 5 — ARM-inspired features (in progress)

### Completed tasks

- [x] **TDD-200** — Stall member roster domain model
  References: REQ-200, REQ-201
  Tag: TDD
  Description: Add `members: Set<UUID>` and `maxMembers: Int` to the `Stall` aggregate. Operations: `addMember(uuid): Stall`, `removeMember(uuid): Stall`, both pure and total. Reject `addMember` when `maxMembers >= 0 && members.size >= maxMembers`. Persist via new columns on the stall table (migration `V008__stall_members.sql`). Failing test asserts maxMembers cap rejection.
  Evidence: docs/requirements.md REQ-200 (per-stall member set distinct from owner, persisted), REQ-201 (configurable maxMembers, -1 = unlimited, reject overflow); src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/domain/stall/Stall.kt (existing data class — extend with default-valued fields to keep call sites compiling); src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/infrastructure/persistence/StallRepositorySql.kt (JDBC persistence pattern to extend); src/main/resources/migrations/V007__shop_constraints.sql (last migration — V008 is next); existing test src/test/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/domain/stall/StallTest.kt (asserts/require pattern); java.util.UUID; kotlin.test.assertEquals, assertFailsWith, assertTrue, assertFalse.

- [x] **TDD-201** — Stall member commands
  References: REQ-202, REQ-203
  Tag: TDD
  Description: `/em stall members add|remove|list <stall> [player]` in AdminCommands (player-callable on own stalls). On mutation, sync to WorldGuard region's member set via a new `RegionMemberSync` infrastructure port. Failing test: command rejected for non-owner; accepted for owner; WG sync invoked.
  Evidence: docs/requirements.md REQ-202 (member commands sync to WG + persist), REQ-203 (member grants WG build/interact via region membership); src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/infrastructure/worldguard/WorldGuardRegionProvider.kt (WG adapter pattern: WorldGuard.getInstance().platform.regionContainer + BukkitAdapter.adapt(world)); src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/domain/stall/Stall.kt addMember/removeMember from TDD-200; com.sk89q.worldguard.protection.regions.ProtectedRegion getMembers; com.sk89q.worldguard.domains.DefaultDomain addPlayer/removePlayer; src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/infrastructure/commands/AdminCommands.kt (existing @Subcommand pattern); src/test/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/infrastructure/commands/AdminCommandsTest.kt (MockK ctor-injection pattern); io.mockk.{mockk,every,verify,confirmVerified}.

- [x] **Audit M11** — Guild-stall rent collection (guild bank charge + grace/eviction; extension draws the bank)
  References: audit finding M11
  Tag: TDD
  Description: Collect rent on GUILD-owned stalls from the guild bank. RentCollectionService now branches charge by owner type (SOLO→economy, GUILD→bank). StallRentExtensionService.extend branches charge + refund. 3 new RentCollectionServiceTest + new StallRentExtensionServiceTest with guild cases. SOLO behavior unchanged.
  Evidence: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-04-guild-rent-collection-design.md; RentCollectionService.kt processStall; StallRentExtensionService.kt extend; RentCollectionServiceTest.kt; StallRentExtensionServiceTest.kt.

### Pending tasks

- [x] **TDD-210** — Limit group config + resolution
  References: REQ-210, REQ-211, REQ-213
  Tag: TDD
  Description: Add `limits.<name>` block to `EnthusiaMarketConfig` (named groups with `total: Int` + `regionkinds: Map<String, Int>`). New `LimitResolutionService` resolves a player's effective limits by combining every `enthusiamarket.limit.<name>` permission they hold (best value wins per key). Admin bypass via `enthusiamarket.admin.bypasslimit`. Failing tests cover: single group, multi-group merge, admin bypass.
  Evidence: docs/requirements.md REQ-210 (limits.<name>.{total, regionkinds}; -1 = unlimited), REQ-211 (best value per dimension across permission-held groups), REQ-213 (enthusiamarket.admin.bypasslimit grants unlimited); src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/config/EnthusiaMarketConfig.kt (existing nested-class config pattern); kaml-jvm supports Map<String, Pojo> via Nexus ConfigManager; existing infrastructure permission pattern src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/infrastructure/listeners/ShopCreateListener.kt:113 (player.hasPermission); new PermissionChecker port needed to keep LimitResolutionService out of the Bukkit dependency cone; io.mockk.{mockk,every,verify}; org.junit.jupiter.api.Test, kotlin.test.assertEquals.

- [x] **TDD-211** — Limit enforcement on stall claim
  References: REQ-212
  Tag: TDD
  Description: Gate stall acquisition paths (auction settlement, sell-offer purchase, `/em setowner`) on `LimitResolutionService.canClaim(player, stall)`. Reject with translated lang message `limits.exceeded`. Failing test: player at total cap rejected; player at kind cap rejected; admin always accepted.
  Evidence: docs/requirements.md REQ-212; src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/application/AuctionLifecycleService.kt settleWithWinner at lines 307-329 (settlement entry — limit gate goes BEFORE economy.withdraw to avoid charging on rejection); LimitResolutionService.canClaim/ClaimDecision from TDD-210; existing no-bid branch (lines 282-296) is the right shape to fall through to on rejection (revert AUCTIONING→UNOWNED, close auction without paying). Sell-offer and /em setowner gates deferred: SellOfferService lands in TDD-261; no `setowner` subcommand exists in AdminCommands today. Region kind isn't a Stall field yet (lands with TDD-220) so settlement uses `kind = "default"` for now. io.mockk.{mockk,every,verify,confirmVerified}; org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; kotlin.test.{assertEquals,assertIs}.

- [ ] **TDD-220** — Entity limit group domain
  References: REQ-220, REQ-222
  Tag: TDD
  Description: New `EntityLimitGroup` value object: per-`EntityType` cap + total cap + extras. Attach to `RegionKind`. New `entitylimits.yml` resource + config-load path. Per-stall override stored on `Stall` (`extraEntities`, `extraTotal`). Failing test: group lookup by region kind name; per-stall override merged correctly.
  Evidence: ``

- [ ] **TDD-221** — Entity limit enforcement listener
  References: REQ-221
  Tag: TDD
  Description: `EntityLimitListener` handles `CreatureSpawnEvent`, `EntityPlaceEvent`, `HangingPlaceEvent`. Looks up enclosing stall via WorldGuard, checks against `EntityLimitGroup` count of existing entities, cancels event when over cap. Failing test (MockBukkit): spawn at cap → cancelled; spawn under cap → allowed.
  Evidence: ``

- [x] **TDD-230** — Region info card (command only)
  References: REQ-230
  Tag: TDD
  Description: `/em stall info <stall>` subcommand renders multi-line MiniMessage info card via new lang keys `stall.info.*`.
  Evidence: ``
  Note: REQ-231 sign-click info routing deferred — PurchaseSign has no kind discriminator; revisit post-release.

- [x] **TDD-240** — Particle border outline
  References: REQ-240, REQ-241
  Tag: TDD
  Description: New `ParticleBorderService` (`@Component`). Tracks active outlines as `(player, stall, expiresAt)` triples. Bukkit repeat task at 4-tick interval traces WorldGuard region's bounding box with `Particle.END_ROD` visible only to the requesting player. Hard cap of `particles.maxPerTick` (default 200) — degrade by widening spacing rather than dropping outlines. Failing test: outline added/removed; particle count bound respected.
  Evidence: ``

- [x] **TDD-250** — Stall purchase sign domain
  References: REQ-250, REQ-253
  Tag: TDD
  Description: Domain type `PurchaseSign(stallId, world, x, y, z, kind: BUY|RENT|EXTEND|INFO)`. New `PurchaseSignRepository` port + JDBC impl. Migration `V009__purchase_signs.sql`. Domain operations: render text for current stall state. Failing test: sign render output matches expected lang template per stall state.
  Evidence: ``

- [x] **TDD-251** — Sign creation listener
  References: REQ-251
  Tag: TDD
  Description: `SignChangeEvent` handler: when line 1 == config trigger token and line 2 names an existing stall, register a `PurchaseSign` and re-render lines from lang template. Permission `enthusiamarket.sign.create` required. Failing test: valid sign → persisted + lines overwritten; invalid stall name → rejected with player message.
  Evidence: ``

- [x] **TDD-252** — Sign auto-refresh on state change
  References: REQ-252

  Description: Ship `src/main/resources/entitylimits.yml` with default groups (`default`, `shop`, `farm`) and ensure `plugins/EnthusiaMarket/schematics/` is created on plugin enable. Update `EnthusiaMarketConfig` with a `schematics` block (`enabled`, `directory`) and a `particles` block (`enabled`, `maxPerTick`).
  Evidence: src/main/resources/entitylimits.yml ships `default`/`shop`/`farm` groups with per-entity caps + `_total` (REQ-220). EnthusiaMarket.kt onEnable (after cfg read): creates `File(dataFolder, cfg.schematics.directory)` so the first capture never fails on a missing folder, and `saveResource("entitylimits.yml", false)` on first run (never overwrites local edits). EnthusiaMarketConfig.kt: `schematics` block (enabled, directory) shipped with TDD-270; added `particles` block (enabled, maxPerTick). compileKotlin green.

## Post-release backlog (deferred — NOT in the next-week release)

- [ ] **TDD-290 — Emergency auction on grace expiry**
  References: REQ-280 (DRAFT), REQ-271, REQ-004, REQ-009
  Tag: TDD
  Description: Replace the direct GRACE→UNOWNED eviction in `RentCollectionService.processStall`
  with a transition to `EMERGENCY_AUCTIONING` that opens a system auction for the stall's
  ownership (reuse `AuctionLifecycleService`). On settlement: high bidder → awarded; no bids →
  UNOWNED. Fire the schematic restore (REQ-271) when the emergency auction is **created** so the
  stall is auctioned clean (confirmed intent 2026-06-01). Wire the currently-dead
  `EMERGENCY_AUCTIONING` (and clarify `RE_AUCTIONING`) `StallState` values — they exist in the
  enum and are handled defensively in switches, but nothing transitions into them today.
  Brainstorm/spec REQ-280 out of DRAFT first (open questions: no-bid reset, RE_ vs EMERGENCY_
  split). Current release behaviour: grace expiry evicts directly + resets immediately.
  Evidence: ``

## Task authoring rules

1. Every task has exactly ONE tag (`TDD`, `DOC`, or `INFRA`).
2. `References:` cites at least one REQ-ID from `requirements.md`. If the REQ doesn't exist, run `/spear:spec` first.
3. `Evidence:` starts empty (```). It must be filled before any skill past `spec-done` will run (REQ-030). Each line is a verified source (e.g. `context7:react@19/useEffect`, `src/domain/Order.kt:42`, `docs/implementation.md#3.1`).
4. Task size ceiling: ~1500 tokens of full briefing. If larger, split.
5. A task MUST be achievable by a single SPEAR cycle (`spec → prove → engine → arch → refine` for TDD; `spec → arch → refine` for DOC/INFRA).
6. Mark state as work proceeds: `[~]` when entering `spec`; `[x]` only when `/spear:refine` has cleared state to `idle`.

## Stall fixes 2026-06-15 (player report) — REQ-284..288 + flat-rent config

Player-reported stall issues. Triage: #1 unlimited stalls = config default; #2 $1 rent = formula-on-cheap-stalls (switching to flat); #3 pistons = missing WG flag (bug); #4 timer = static sign + cheap rent; #5 infinite extend = no cap; #6 no numbers = UX.

  Description: Add config `limits` default (e.g. `EnthusiaMarketConfig` field `defaultStallLimit: Int = -1`).
  In `LimitResolutionService.effectiveLimits`, when no group matches, return `EffectiveLimits(total =
  config.defaultStallLimit, ...)` instead of UNLIMITED. -1 preserves today's behavior; live config sets 1.
  Failing test first: no-group player with defaultStallLimit=1 → canClaim rejects the 2nd stall; -1 → unlimited.
  Evidence:
  ```
  EnthusiaMarketConfig.kt:94-100 (added defaultStallLimit: Int = -1)
  LimitResolutionService.kt:65-68 (no-group branch returns config.defaultStallLimit, not UNLIMITED)

  References: REQ-286, src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/application/StallRentExtensionService.kt:44-112, EnthusiaMarketConfig
  Tag: TDD
  Description: Add config `rent.maxPrepaidPeriods: Int` (e.g. 7; <=0 = unlimited). In `extend`, before charging,
  reject when `nextRentAt` is already >= now + maxPrepaidPeriods*interval with `Result.Rejected`. Failing test
  first: extend rejected once cap reached; allowed below cap; unlimited when config <=0.

  Description: Rent terms are stored per-stall at import, so flipping config to flat does NOT reach existing
  stalls (the actual complaint). Added RentTermsResyncService.resync() + `/em rent resync` admin command.
  TDD on the service. Deploy seq: set config flat → `/em rent resync`.
  Evidence:

  Tag: INFRA
  Description: Set live config `rent.mode: flat`, `rent.flatAmount: 100`. THEN run `/em rent resync` (ST-7) so
  existing stalls adopt the new terms — config alone only affects newly-imported stalls. Deploy-time step.

## Feature 2026-06-15 — /shop search item tab-completion (REQ-283)

`/shop search <item>` takes a raw String with no suggestions. Add Brigadier tab-completion of item
material names via nexus-paper's `@Suggests` + a named `SuggestionProvider`. Layer split: the
prefix-match is pure (stdlib, application, TDD-able); the item-material name source (`Material.entries`
filtered by `isItem`) and provider wiring live in infrastructure (Bukkit-coupled).

  References: REQ-283, implementation.md §2 (application may use domain + stdlib only — no org.bukkit)
  Tag: TDD

  typed: String): List<String>` — returns candidates whose name starts with `typed` case-insensitively,
  preserving input order, full list when `typed` is blank. No Bukkit import (arch denylist). Failing

## Perf 2026-06-14 — hopper control hot-path DB I/O (spark: 5.85% server thread)

Root cause: `HopperControlListener.onHopperMove` (fires per hopper transfer tick) calls
`ShopRepository.findByContainer` → synchronous SQLite query on the server thread, up to twice
per event, with no in-memory short-circuit. `idx_shop_container` already exists, so the cost is
call frequency, not query plan (`prepareStatement` alone = 2.16%). Fix: an authoritative
in-memory shop-container index; the hot path never touches the DB. Spark report
https://spark.lucko.me/3RFbDGJIef.

**Sync mechanism — DECIDED 2026-06-14: decorator, not events.** All ~25 `ShopRepository`
consumers (application services, listeners, commands, Bedrock forms, GUI menus) inject the
`ShopRepository` *interface*; DI resolves it via `getBean<ShopRepository>()`. An
`IndexedShopRepository` decorator therefore covers every mutation path transparently with zero
call-site edits, and is the single choke point that cannot be bypassed. Event-driven sync was
rejected: `ShopCreatedEvent` fires only in `SignPlaceListener:216` (NOT in `CreateShopMenu:82`
or `BedrockCreateShopForm:59`), and `ShopDeletedEvent` misses `DeleteShopsMenu:38` /
`ShopEditMenu:131` — those gaps would leave locked shops hopper-exploitable. Container coords are
set only at insert (no relocate path), so create + delete fully cover location changes.

### TDD tasks

- [x] **PERF-1** — `ShopLocationIndex` domain port + in-memory adapter
  References: REQ-282, implementation.md §2 (layer rules), §3.4 (ports), src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/domain/shop/ShopRepository.kt
  Tag: TDD
  Description: Add domain port `domain/shop/ShopLocationIndex` exposing `shopsAt(world, x, y, z): List<Shop>`
  (empty when none), `put(shop)`, `remove(shop)`, `rebuild(shops: Collection<Shop>)`. Add an in-memory
  adapter (application layer, stdlib only) keyed by a packed (world, x, y, z) coordinate. Failing test

  References: REQ-282, src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/infrastructure/persistence/ShopRepositorySql.kt, implementation.md §2
  Tag: TDD
  Description: Implement `IndexedShopRepository` (application layer) decorating any `ShopRepository`
  delegate (decision locked above): delegate every mutation (upsert/insert/update, delete,
  deleteByContainer, deleteByOwner, setGuildOwnership, removeGuildOwnership), update the
  `ShopLocationIndex` after each, and serve `findByContainer` from the index. Upsert replaces the
  prior entry for the same id so changed hopperAllowIn/Out flags are visible (no duplicate);
  `delete(id)` resolves coords via delegate `findById` (write path, not the hot path). `updateStock`
  need not move index keys. (Double-chest half-resolution is PERF-3's listener concern, not the
  repo's.) Failing test first with a mockk delegate: after each mutating op the index matches the
  persisted set; `findByContainer` returns from the index with `verify(exactly = 0)` on the
  delegate's `findByContainer`.

- [x] **PERF-3** — hopper control resolves via index, zero DB queries on server thread (MERGED INTO PERF-4 2026-06-15: listener needs no code change — PERF-2's decorator already makes findByContainer index-backed, so no TDD red is possible; the hopper guard test ships as PERF-4's regression proof)
  References: REQ-281, src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/infrastructure/listeners/HopperControlListener.kt
  Tag: TDD
  Description: With the decorator serving `findByContainer` from memory, `HopperControlListener` likely
  needs no code change — it keeps its `ShopRepository` dependency and receives the decorator via DI.
  Failing test first: inject an `IndexedShopRepository` built over a SQL-delegate spy whose
  `findByContainer`/`queryMany` fail the test if invoked, populate the index, drive the hopper decision,
  and assert correct cancel decisions for hopperAllowIn/hopperAllowOut and pass-through for non-shop
  containers — proving REQ-281's "no DB query on the server thread". If the listener is left untouched,
  this task reduces to the guarding test only.
  Evidence: ``

### INFRA tasks

- [x] **PERF-4** — DI wiring: build, rebuild-on-enable, inject (+ PERF-3 guard test) [code done; runtime DI-boot verification pending — see PERF-VERIFY]
  References: REQ-281, REQ-282, src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/EnthusiaMarket.kt, implementation.md §3.9
  Tag: INFRA
  Description: Drop `@Repository` from `ShopRepositorySql` (a second bean under the `ShopRepository`
  interface makes nexus DI ambiguous), build `ShopRepositorySql → InMemoryShopLocationIndex →
  IndexedShopRepository` in `onEnable` after the DataSource is registered and before
  registerPaperCommands/registerNexusListeners construct consumers, rebuild the index from
  `shopSqlRepo.all()` (REQ-282), and register the decorator as the sole `ShopRepository` bean (+ the
  index under `ShopLocationIndex`). All ~25 consumers inject the interface, so they transparently get
  the decorator; `HopperControlListener` then resolves from the index (REQ-281). Ships the PERF-3
  guard test. Live verification required (no test boots the DI graph).
  Evidence:
  ```
  src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/EnthusiaMarket.kt:103-122 (wiring inserted right after ctx.registerBean dataSource, before registerPaperCommands at ~125; fully-qualified refs so no new imports)
  src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/infrastructure/persistence/ShopRepositorySql.kt:12 (@Repository removed; constructed manually now)
  src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/application/IndexedShopRepository.kt (PERF-2 decorator wired as the bean)
  src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/application/InMemoryShopLocationIndex.kt (PERF-1 index, rebuilt on enable)
  src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/domain/shop/ShopLocationIndex.kt (registered under this type)
  nexus DI mechanics (nexus-core v2.1.1 sources): ComponentRegistry.typeIndex indexes a bean under its type + implemented interfaces; BeanFactory.getBean(type) throws "Multiple beans found of type" when >1 match — so ShopRepositorySql must not stay @Repository while the decorator is registered under ShopRepository. registerBean runs post-create, before first getBean (lazy factories), so the decorator is the only ShopRepository definition.
  src/test/kotlin/architecture/ListenerWiringTest.kt (Konsist static analysis only — does not boot NexusContext, so removing @Repository does not break it)
  src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/infrastructure/listeners/HopperControlListener.kt (unchanged; receives the decorator via DI)
  guard-test imports: io.mockk.mockk ; io.mockk.every ; io.mockk.verify ; net.badgersmc.em.application.IndexedShopRepository ; net.badgersmc.em.application.InMemoryShopLocationIndex ; net.badgersmc.em.domain.shop.Shop ; net.badgersmc.em.domain.shop.ShopRepository ; org.bukkit.Location ; org.bukkit.block.Block ; org.bukkit.block.Container ; org.bukkit.event.inventory.InventoryMoveItemEvent ; org.bukkit.inventory.Inventory ; org.bukkit.inventory.ItemStack ; java.util.UUID ; kotlin.test.Test ; kotlin.test.assertTrue
  ```

### DOC tasks

- [x] **PERF-5** — document the index component + data flow
  References: REQ-281, REQ-282, implementation.md §3, docs/db-schema.md
  Tag: DOC
  Description: Add a component-design entry for `ShopLocationIndex` (layer, port, adapter, evidence
  sources) and a data-flow subsection for the hopper hot path in `implementation.md`. (db-schema.md does
  not document indexes, so no edit there — idx_shop_container now backs admin/maintenance reads, not the
  hopper hot path; recorded here instead.)
  Evidence:
  ```
  docs/implementation.md §3.9 (decorator wiring note), §3.10 (ShopLocationIndex + IndexedShopRepository component), §4.6 (hopper hot-path data flow) — added this task
  src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/domain/shop/ShopLocationIndex.kt ; src/main/kotlin/net/badgersmc/em/application/IndexedShopRepository.kt (cited as evidence sources in §3.10)
  docs/db-schema.md (inspected: no index documentation section, so nothing to amend)
  ```

- [x] **PERF-VERIFY** — live runtime verification of the hopper fix
  References: REQ-281, REQ-282
  Tag: INFRA
  Description: No unit test boots NexusContext, so PERF-4's DI wiring is unproven at runtime. On a server
  (test server, or the live server during a low-population window — NOT a hot-swap on 33 live players):
  build the shadowJar, deploy, confirm clean enable (no "Multiple beans"/"No bean" for ShopRepository,
  "EnthusiaMarket enabled" logged), exercise a locked-hopper shop, then re-run a spark profiler and
  confirm HopperControlListener.onHopperMove / ShopRepositorySql.findByContainer is gone from the
  server-thread hot path (was 5.85%, baseline https://spark.lucko.me/3RFbDGJIef).
  DI-BOOT VERIFIED 2026-06-15 on test server C:\Users\Noah\Desktop\test_net\lobby\SanityCheck (Leaf
  1.21.11, full deps): "EnthusiaMarket enabled (v0.2.0)", 0 ShopRepository DI errors, HopperControlListener
  registered (index-backed repo), 14 @Listener beans, server reached Done. (Had to swap the test box's
  stale LumaGuilds-2.1.0.jar — missing net.lumalyte.lg.api.GuildLookup — for the freshly-built one;
  stale copy saved as plugins/LumaGuilds-2.1.0.jar.stale-bak.)
  SPARK PROOF DONE 2026-06-15: fix deployed to live (remote 170.205.24.14), 25 players, TPS 20.00 (was 18.34
  @33 players pre-fix). Profile https://spark.lucko.me/ZNDUJN57Yg (3.2MB, populated): net/badgersmc =
  net.badgersmc = badgersmc/em = onHopperMove = HopperControlListener = findByContainer = ShopRepositorySql =
  IndexedShopRepository = 0 hits, while vanilla HopperBlockEntity=51 + InventoryMoveItem=10 confirm hoppers
  were active and lumalyte=57 confirms plugin frames CAN appear. EM hopper SQL hotspot (was 5.85% top of
  Server thread, baseline https://spark.lucko.me/3RFbDGJIef) is eliminated. Gotcha: `--thread "Server thread"`
  yielded an empty "No Data" profile on this Leaf server; run `/spark profiler start --timeout N` WITHOUT a
  thread filter (matches how the baseline was captured). Pre-existing unrelated finding: BlockProtectionListener,
  ExplodeCleanupListener, ShopCreateListener, ShopInteractListener fail to register — inject
  java.util.logging.Logger with no Logger bean (not caused by PERF; flagged as separate task).
  Evidence: spark report ZNDUJN57Yg vs baseline 3RFbDGJIef; live TPS via papermcp server_info.

## Unified Shop Creation & Menu UX (REQ-289..295)

### TDD-289 — Unified creation GUI with direction picker

- [x] TDD: RED — Write failing test: CreateShopMenu opens with direction selector (SELL/BUY/TRADE buttons)
- [x] TDD: GREEN — Add direction picker to CreateShopMenu. Replace hardcoded `SignDirection.SELL` in ShopCreateListener
  with GUI-chosen direction. Update BedrockCreateShopForm to include direction toggle.
- [x] Add cost-type picker: Vault currency (default) vs barter item. For barter, capture item from player hand
  (mirrors TRADE line-3 parsing in SignPlaceListener) and set costItem + costAmount.
- [x] Update `ShopFactory.build` call site in both GUIs to pass the chosen direction + cost values.
- **Ref:** REQ-289, REQ-012
- **Evidence:** ShopFactory.kt:30-31 — `costItemBase64: String? = null, costAmountOverride: Int? = null`; CreateShopMenu.kt:31-65 — direction selector row, cost picker, confirm passes direction+params; CreateShopMenuDirectionTest.kt — GREEN test asserts costItemBase64 + costAmountOverride round-trip

### TDD-290 — Sign text opens GUI instead of creating directly

- [x] TDD: RED — Write failing test: SignPlaceListener.onSignPlace with [BUY] opens CreateShopMenu pre-populated
  with direction=BUY instead of creating shop directly
- [x] TDD: GREEN — Change SignPlaceListener to open CreateShopMenu (or BedrockCreateShopForm) with parsed
  direction, amount, cost pre-filled. Remove direct Shop construction from SignPlaceListener.
- [x] Update ShopSignRenderer to use `"Buy"`/`"Sell"`/`"Trade"` instead of raw `direction.name`.
- **Ref:** REQ-290, REQ-005 (superseded)
- **Evidence:** SignPlaceListener.kt:170-207 — opens CreateShopMenu instead of constructing Shop; SignPlaceListenerTest.kt — verifies event cancelled, upsert never called; ShopSignRenderer.kt — human-readable direction names

### TDD-291 — PurchaseMenu context (owner, stock, direction)

- [x] TDD: RED — Write failing test: PurchaseMenu renders owner name, stock count, and direction label
- [x] TDD: GREEN — Add owner name (from Bukkit.getOfflinePlayer), trades-available (from shop.stockCount /
  sellAmount), and direction label to PurchaseMenu + BedrockPurchaseForm
- **Ref:** REQ-291
- **Evidence:** PurchaseMenu.kt:50-68 — added ownerName from Bukkit.getOfflinePlayer, tradesAvailable from stockCount/sellAmount, dirLabel from direction; en_US.yml:276-278 — gui.shop.sell_lore_direction/owner/stock keys

### TDD-292 — OwnedShopsMenu status in lore

- [x] TDD: RED — Write failing test: OwnedShopsMenu icon lore includes direction, stock, frozen
- [x] TDD: GREEN — Add direction string, trades-available, and frozen state to OwnedShopsMenu icon lore
- **Ref:** REQ-292
- **Evidence:** OwnedShopsMenu.kt:32-43 — dirLabel, tradesAvailable, frozenLabel added to lore; en_US.yml:316-318 — gui.shop.owned.dir_lore/stock_lore/frozen_lore

### TDD-293 — ShopEditMenu shows stock + direction

- [x] TDD: RED — Write failing test: ShopEditMenu displays stock count and direction
- [x] TDD: GREEN — Add stock count (shop.stockCount / sellAmount) and direction label to ShopEditMenu
- **Ref:** REQ-293
- **Evidence:** ShopEditMenu.kt:58-71 — OAK_SIGN info item at (0,1) with direction label + stock count lore; en_US.yml:321-322 — gui.shop.edit.direction/stock keys

### TDD-294 — SearchResultsMenu direction in lore

- [x] TDD: RED — Write failing test: search result lore includes direction (BUY/SELL/TRADE)
- [x] TDD: GREEN — Add direction to SearchResultsMenu result lore line
- **Ref:** REQ-294
- **Evidence:** SearchResultsMenu.kt:46-52 — dirLabel with MiniMessage color tags added to lang.msg; en_US.yml:291 — gui.shop.search.result now includes <dir> placeholder

### INFRA-295 — Normalize GUI text (remove bold, standardize colors)

- [x] Remove all `<bold>` tags from `en_US.yml` GUI entries.
- [x] Standardize color scheme per REQ-295: green=action, red=delete, gold=currency, white=info, gray=secondary,
  aqua=nav, yellow=warning, light_purple=barter/TRADE.
- [x] Verify no `<em>`, `<i>`, `<bold>`, `<b>` tags remain in GUI keys.
- **REF:** REQ-295
- **Evidence:** en_US.yml — 11 `<bold>` tags removed; zero `<em>/<i>/<b>/<bold>` tags remaining; colors already aligned per existing convention

## Wiki — GitHub Pages player docs (REQ-296..298)

### DOC-296 — Wiki scaffold: mkdocs config, directory structure, and all content pages

- [x] **DOC-296** — Build the complete mkdocs-material wiki mirroring LumaGuilds layout
  References: REQ-296, REQ-297
  Tag: DOC
  Description: Create `mkdocs.yml` (site name "EnthusiaMarket", URL `badgersmc.github.io/EnthusiaMarket`, indigo theme, awesome-pages, redirects, llmstxt plugins). Create `wiki/requirements.txt` (mkdocs 1.6.1, material 9.5.49, awesome-pages 2.9.3, redirects 1.2.2, llmstxt 0.2.0). Create `wiki/docs/.pages` defining Getting Started → Players → Admins → Developers nav order. Create `wiki/docs/index.md` (home page with nav cards). Create `wiki/docs/getting-started/` (welcome, walkthrough, faq). Create `wiki/docs/players/` (how-do-i, stalls, rent, shop-creation, buy-sell-trade, barter-vault, shop-search, shop-management, bedrock). Create `wiki/docs/admins/` (installation, config, permissions, integration, geyser, troubleshooting). Create `wiki/docs/developers/` (architecture, domain, application, infrastructure). All pages must carry YAML frontmatter matching LumaGuilds schema (title, audience, topic, summary, keywords, related, updated). Cross-reference links must be relative and valid. Verify with `mkdocs build --strict` → 0 warnings.
  Evidence: `mkdocs build --strict` passes 0 warnings; lint_frontmatter.py 28/28 pages OK; check_topic_parity.py 14/14 player pages OK; 33 files committed (28 wiki pages + 5 config/tool files); PR #74`

### INFRA-296 — Wiki CI workflows, lint tools, and markdown lint config

- [x] **INFRA-296** — Add wiki quality gates and auto-deployment
  References: REQ-297, REQ-298
  Tag: INFRA
  Description: Create `.github/workflows/wiki-deploy.yml` (build + deploy to GitHub Pages on push to main touching wiki/**, mkdocs.yml). Create `.github/workflows/wiki-checks.yml` (frontmatter lint, topic parity, markdown lint, mkdocs strict build on PR). Create `tools/wiki/lint_frontmatter.py` (pyyaml-based frontmatter validator). Create `tools/wiki/check_topic_parity.py` (ensure every wiki page topic has a corresponding in-game help topic). Create `.markdownlint.jsonc` (MD013/025/033/034/041/047/060 off, MD031/040 on, MD024 siblings_only). Verify wiki-deploy.yml targets `badgersmc.github.io/EnthusiaMarket`.
  Evidence: `mkdocs.yml site_url: badgersmc.github.io/EnthusiaMarket; wiki-deploy.yml pushes on main; wiki-checks.yml 4 jobs (frontmatter-lint, topic-parity, markdown-lint, mkdocs-strict-build); lint_frontmatter.py adapted from LumaGuilds (SLUG_EXEMPT reduced to index.md only); check_topic_parity.py adapted for EM (frontmatter check only, no HelpTopics yet); .markdownlint.jsonc copied from LumaGuilds`
