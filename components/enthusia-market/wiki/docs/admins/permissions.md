## Limit groups

Permission nodes matching `enthusiamarket.limit.<group-name>` grant membership in a named limit group from config. Effective limits merge by taking the best value per dimension across all granted groups.

Example:

```text
enthusiamarket.limit.vip      → total: 3 stalls
enthusiamarket.limit.premium  → total: 10 stalls
```

Players with no limit group get `defaultStallLimit` (config, default -1 = unlimited).
