/**
 * Guild disband cleanup (M-16). Frees every stall owned by the
 * disbanded guild and unbinds every shop registered to that guild.
 *
 * Best-effort: a single failure (e.g. one stall evicts cleanly but
 * another throws) must not abort the rest of the cleanup. Each item
 * is wrapped in its own try/catch so the operator gets a complete
 * sweep even if some entries are partially broken.
 *
 * Stalls are evicted via [StallEvictionService.evict] so all the
 * usual side-effects (WG region reset, schematic restore, state
 * event) run — we never duplicate the eviction logic here. Stalls
 * that are owned by the guild but in a non-OWNED/GRACE state (e.g.
 * mid-auction) will be left alone by evict, which is the same
 * behaviour as a manual `/em evict` and is acceptable for a
 * dissolve.
