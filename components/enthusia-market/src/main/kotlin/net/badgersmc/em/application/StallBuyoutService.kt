/**
 * Orchestrates outright "click-the-sign-to-buy" stall purchases (REQ-250).
 *
 * Used by [net.badgersmc.em.infrastructure.listeners.PurchaseSignClickListener]
 * to convert a buyer + price + UNOWNED stall into ownership. Designed
 * for the post-initial-auction lifecycle: once the one-shot mass
 * auction has run, every remaining or evicted stall becomes buyable
 * via its purchase sign at the price written on line 3.
 *
 * Compensation order matches `AuctionLifecycleService.settleWithWinner`
 * and `SellOfferService.purchase`: withdraw → persist → fire event.
 * If withdraw fails the buyer is untouched and no state moves.
