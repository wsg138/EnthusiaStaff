/**
 * Block all raw item movement in a menu (anti-dupe).

 * double-click *collect-to-cursor* sweep (which vacuums matching items out of the menu's
 * displayed slots into the player's cursor) and item *drags* uncancelled — so a player can pull
 * the real `ItemStack`s a menu renders (vault contents, sell/cost previews, search icons) into
 * their own inventory for free. This is an item dupe / theft.
 *
 * Cancelling every click + drag closes all of those vectors. Intended menu actions are driven by
 * `GuiItem` `onClick` consumers (plain code), which IFramework still invokes even when the event
 * is cancelled — so buttons, toggles, paging, and click-to-withdraw keep working; only vanilla
 * item movement is blocked. None of EM's Java menus accept item drop-in, so a blanket cancel is
 * always correct here.

 * Block top-inventory item theft while allowing the player to interact with their

 * player can drop an item into the menu (e.g. banner slot, barter trade cost slot).
 *
 * - All top-inventory clicks are cancelled EXCEPT on [placementSlots].
 *
 * Bottom inventory is left untouched — setOnBottomClick in IFramework 0.11.6
 * interferes with normal inventory interaction even when the handler only cancels
 * shift-clicks.  Top-inventory-only blocking is sufficient: double-click
 * collect-to-cursor targets the clicked slot (top inventory, already cancelled),
 * and shift-click into the menu only populates virtual slots that get re-rendered.
