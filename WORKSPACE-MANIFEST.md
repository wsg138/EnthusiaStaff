Do not invent a remote or push to an upstream owner. |
| EnthusiaMarket | `https://github.com/wsg138/EnthusiaMarket.git` | `main` (`bc24f10`) | `agent/moderation-api` (expected; absent remotely) | No target-layout clone; sibling checkout is detached at `2c06a1a` | No feature-branch SHA | None | NOT_RUN | NOT_RUN | NOT_RUN | UNVERIFIED | UNKNOWN | Provider branch must be reconstructed from current main. Existing sibling checkout is detached and has an upstream BadgersMC remote; no Enthusia work may be pushed there. |

## Root recovery evidence

- Canonical remote: `wsg138/EnthusiaStaff`
- Remote default branch: `main`
- Remote feature branch: `agent/complete-staff-platform`
- `main`: `b87a13bbe6aaa62500b578c78e557e0bf1a4c705`
- Feature branch: `c4fd4129f7a34ad011f87f146fb72c236e611b89`
- GitHub comparison at recovery: 9 commits ahead, 0 behind `main`
- Existing history action: no rebase, reset, or force-push was required
- Merge commit: `b5e55ed9ffd7309cacabf6b0a07af220068f3c30`
- PR #1 outcome: merged with history preserved; the source branch was retained
- Pre-existing goals file SHA-256 before and after checkout: `746DD1B37BBAF517F008441102A6CBF688AABEC09E8196F863509BF484277F9A`
- Root local exclusion: `related-repos/` is present in `.git/info/exclude`

## Workspace layout status

The root worktree and reports are represented by `EnthusiaStaff.code-workspace`.
Related repository paths are declared under `related-repos/`, but cloning is
intentionally deferred until the required EnthusiaStaff Codacy cleanup
checkpoint. Existing sibling worktrees are read-only recovery references and
are not treated as the requested final layout.

## Checkpoint rules

- Update every SHA, PR, build, test, Docker, coverage, Codacy, and blocker field after each coherent checkpoint.
- A skipped Docker test is recorded as skipped, never passed.
- A Codacy grade remains unverified until the actual branch analysis is read.
- Keep each nested repository independent; never stage `related-repos/` in the root repository.
